Markup: 
	1. Signup for GitHub using this link https://github.com/signup?ref_cta=Sign+up&ref_loc=header+logged+out&ref_page=%2F&source=header-home. GitHub will then lead you through the process of creating an account.
	2. Download GitBash using this link https://git-scm.com/downloads. Select the download of for your operating system and download GitBash.
	3. When GitBash is done downloading, find the download and install GitBash.
	4. Return to GitHub. You should be on your page. On the left side, locate the green button with the word 'New' next to an image of a book. Click on that.
	5. Name your repository, select if it is public or private, and click the checkbox next to 'Add a README file'. You can also click on the checkbox next to 'Add .gitignore', but it is not needed.
	6. Create a local repository by making an empty folder on your pc.
	7. Right click, and click on the 'Git Bash here' option. This will open up GitBash with the directory of that folder.
	8. With GitBash open, type 'git init'. This will initialize the local directory as a Git Repository
	9. Create a READEME.md file if you have not done so already, or have not selected the checkbox in step 5.
	10. Use command 'git add ." to add all files in your local repository to be commited and pushed to GitHub. Alternatively, you can use 'git add [name of file]' to add specific file
	11. Use command 'git commit -m "commit message" to commit the push. Make sure that the message is meaningful and descriptive
	12. Use command 'git branch -M main' to connect to your main branch.
	13. You will now need either the HTTPS or the SSH of your GitHub repository. You can find it on your repository by clicking the green button that says 'code'. Git hub might also give you the HTTPS or SSH on the repo, as well as a quick start guide.
	14. Using the HTTPS or SSH, use command 'git remote add origin [HTTPS or SSH]' to connect to your local and remote repositories.
	15. Use command 'git push -u origin main' to push local changes onto your remote repository.
	16. Go onto 'https://www.jetbrains.com/community/education/#students' and scroll down to 'apply now'. Enter in relevant information. For the email, make sure to use your school email.
	17. If you are renewing your subscription, then check your email for the renewal email, if not, check your email and confirm your subscription.
	18. You now have multiple jetbrain programs to chose from. We are using Webstorm so download Webstorm.

	22. You now need to get the path to your Git executable. Simply search up Git, right click, open path, and then copy the directory. Post that into 'Path to Git Executable'. Click on Test to make sure you have the right path. Path may vary but for me it was D:\NJIT\Spring 2022\IS219\Git\bin\git.exe
	23. Now go to Appearance and Behaviors, System Settings, and then Passwords. Add a location for the password file. You might be instructed to add a master password if you select a custom location. Click OK on the bottom
